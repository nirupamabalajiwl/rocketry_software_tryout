# Telemetry Visualizer Project
Reasoning behind the project:
So there were three main things that really prompted me create and do this specific project.
    
1. I was working with OpenRocket and when I was looking at the flight simulations, there was a plot that popped up with all of these like different pieces of data and I thought it would be really cool to recreate it with my own data simulating a telemetry. I choose a telemetry specifically because telemeteries often measure things like temperature, altitude, and velocity and relay that information back to, often, a ground control system. I also thought it would be somewhat on theme as telemetries as used by many aviation vehicles. 

2. I work with a lot of things like telemetries and I thought it would be a really cool way to get more experience with these parts as I did need to do additional research to ensure I was collecting the correct kind of data and in general it was fun doing a project related to things I have worked with in the past!

3. I've never worked with MatplotLib so I thought this would be the perfect time to work with and get accustomed to it!

Challenges I ran into:
1. So this was my first time working with my own repo as often I worked with others on code and they would handle the gitHub and working with git on their laptop, but this time as I wasn't I had to learn it. Out of this, I learned how to use gitHub + Git, work with enviornments because it just made the process faster, and overall, I have a better understanding of how GitHub works.

2. I had some issues with being able to use the data sample I created within my visualizer, but overcame this problem. The problem had turned out to be I was not calling the sample correctly within my code.

Uses for this project:
Again, this is essentially a simulation where you can change your Telemetry Data to change what is going on to see what the potential reactions of the surroundings may be.
